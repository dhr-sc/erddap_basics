# Preface{-}  
These exercises are materials for the NOAA Satellite Training Course offered each year by regional nodes of NOAA's CoastWatch program. They demonstrate the features of the ERDDAP data servers and hands-on training on how to use the feature. Participants will subset and download data, create mapped images, visualize wind vector fields, and generate timeseries and Hovm√∂ller diagrams.  

Suggested software includes a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit and the netCDF file viewer Panoply (www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/). 

Additional course materials are available at these locations:  

* ERDDAP tutorial (coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/projects/nb/)
* R tutorials (coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/projects/r/), 
* R notebooks (github.com/dhr-sc/text_book

## NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch Program{-}  

NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch provides easy access for everyone to global and regional satellite data products for use in understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate.
